# mayaXrayScript
A simple mel script for Autodesk Maya to toggle transparency on individual objects. Simply copy and paste into the Maya Script Editor as mel and then go File -> Save Script To Shell in order to have a toggle button.
Tested with Maya 2019 but should work just fine with earlier or 2020.
