# mayaXrayScript
A simple mel script for Autodesk Maya to toggle transparency on individual objects. Simply copy and paste into the Maya Script Editor as mel and then go "File" -> "Save Script to Shelf" in order to have a toggle button. Make sure you have the proper shelf tab open before you do so.
Tested with Maya 2019 but should work just fine with earlier or 2020.
